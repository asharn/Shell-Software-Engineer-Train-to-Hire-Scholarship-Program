## Overview
After completing this degree, you will have enough knowledge to start implementing npm, node, react and other projects in your work. I am always learning and I take many online courses myself! So I know how difficult it was to take time out of your schedule and dedicate the many hours of hard work it took to complete this course. I know that there were some very difficult concepts to learn, some of the quizzes and coding exercises were tough, and the projects were challenging.
