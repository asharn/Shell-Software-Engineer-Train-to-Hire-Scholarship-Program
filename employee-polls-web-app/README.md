# Employee Polls Project

This is the starter code for the assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course.

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data. The only thing you need to edit in the ` _DATA.js` file is the value of `avatarURL`. Each user should have an avatar, so you’ll need to add the path to each user’s avatar.

You can check content of `_DATA.js` by using this [Link](https://github.com/asharn/Shell-Software-Engineer-Train-to-Hire-Scholarship-Program/blob/main/employee-polls-web-app/src/utils/_DATA.js).

The details about the table and api functions is shown in [README.md](https://github.com/asharn/Shell-Software-Engineer-Train-to-Hire-Scholarship-Program/blob/main/employee-polls-web-app/src/utils/README.md).

You can view live application on Netlify by using this [**Netlify Live Employee Polls Web App**](https://employee-polls.netlify.app/).

## Hosted on Netlify
This app is deployed on Netlify, so if any one want to check the functionality live then click [**Netlify Live Employee Polls Web App**](https://employee-polls.netlify.app/). 
I have done some testing on this site. So, go check soon. And if you find any issue please raise concern as issue in git repo, pointing the issue.

## Hosted on Heroku
This app is hoted on heroku, so if any one want to check the functionality and check with this [**Heroku Live Employee Polls Web App**](https://employee-polls-web-app.herokuapp.com/). 

In Heroku hosted, you will see some glitches in style and images which is cause due to Heroku hosting. So, can only verify functionality which will be working correctly.

AWS s3 bucket is not connected, so uploading of images and other files will not work.
